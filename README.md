    <ul>
      <li><p>Extraction and purification of the DNA template (even RNA must usually be converted to cDNA)</p></li>
      <li><p>Fragmentation of the DNA template (into a size range that can be accommodated by the machine)</p></li>
      <li><p>Attachment of sequencing tags (to enable reading by the machine)</p></li>
      <li><p>Amplification of signal (usually trough PCR, often already in the machine)</p></li>
      <li><p>Reading of signal and conversion into nucleotide bases</p></li>
    </ul>

A quizz, wait until the Delivery version is ready and the login to Room 32COU as a Student.

<strong>Here link to video of Definition slides</strong>

<strong>Here link to embedded Databases ppt which is simple enough to downgrade to PDF</strong>

Maybe some string to hang together Intro talk about the exercise(s), Aniridia etc etc here
Too early for detail, but would be good to keep rambling on track!!!

<strong>Exercise 1: Information from Web Resouces</strong>

<a href="https://github.com/BioinformaticsTraining/Introduction/raw/master/Practical_PDFs/01-Databases_Practical.pdf" download>Click here to assemble the Instructions in a local PDF viewer.</a>

<strong>Link to video for dotplots ... plus download for ppt/video (or maybe that in "all course logical tar"?)</strong>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfFfSxZWQKU&t=327s"> Here for youtube version</a>

<a href="https://github.com/BioinformaticsTraining/Introduction/raw/master/Videos/DotPlots.mp4" download>Click here for a short video</a>

 <video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="Videos/DotPvvvlots.mp4" type="video/mp4"> ffff
</video> 



Deal with Intro talk/ppt here
ppt too involved for PDF ... Do not want to simplify ... Do want to split in at least 2
No point launchin in powerpoint unless we go back to windows
Maybe simple download (or nothing) only option

<strong>Exercise 2: A look at Pairwise Alignment</strong>
