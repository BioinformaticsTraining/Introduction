</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Extraction and purification of the DNA template (even RNA must usually be converted to cDNA)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fragmentation of the DNA template (into a size range that can be accommodated by the machine)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachment of sequencing tags (to enable reading by the machine)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amplification of signal (usually trough PCR, often already in the machine)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reading of signal and conversion into nucleotide bases</p>
</li>
</ul>
