    <ul>
      <li><p>Extraction and purification of the DNA template (even RNA must usually be converted to cDNA)</p></li>
      <li><p>Fragmentation of the DNA template (into a size range that can be accommodated by the machine)</p></li>
      <li><p>Attachment of sequencing tags (to enable reading by the machine)</p></li>
      <li><p>Amplification of signal (usually trough PCR, often already in the machine)</p></li>
      <li><p>Reading of signal and conversion into nucleotide bases</p></li>
    </ul>

A quizz, wait until the Delivery version is ready and the login to Room 32COU as a Student.

# Here link to video of Definition slides

# Here link to embedded Databases ppt which is simple enough to downgrade to PDF

Maybe some string to hang together Intro talk about the exercise(s), Aniridia etc etc here
Too early for detail, but would be good to keep rambling on track!!!

# Exercise 1: Information from Web Resouces

<a href="https://github.com/BioinformaticsTraining/Introduction/raw/master/Practical_PDFs/01-Databases_Practical.pdf" download>Click here to start assemble the Instructions in a local PDF viewer.</a>

Link to video for dotplots ... plus download for ppt/video (or maybe that in "all course logical tar"?)
   <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfFfSxZWQKU&t=327s"> Here for youtube version>
   <a href="https://github.com/BioinformaticsTraining/Introduction/raw/master/Videos/DotPlots.mp4">Click here for a short video 
Deal with Intro talk/ppt here
ppt too involved for PDF ... Do not want to simplify ... Do want to split in at least 2
No point launchin in powerpoint unless we go back to windows
Maybe simple download (or nothing) only option

# Exercise 2: A look at Pairwise Alignment

<a href="https://github.com/BioinformaticsTraining/Introduction/raw/master/Practical_PDFs/02-Pairwise_Alignment_Practical.pdf" download>Click here to start assemble the Instructions in a local PDF viewer.</a>
