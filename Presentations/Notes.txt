==========

This is a messy partial collection representing the last 100 years!

What I need NOW is a set of what I use currently

What I need long term is a real "Development" set up ... as I think I finally have for the Practicals.
Needs thought
I archive all this stuff soemwhere not on github maybe?

I get the hang of this one day ... maybe
First I work out how to do a sensible Master branch

Whatever ... sort it for tomorrow Dave!!!
