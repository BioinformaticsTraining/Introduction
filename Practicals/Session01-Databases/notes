INITIAL PHASE - 2016.07.25-29
=============================

---ncbi 
---genes
---advanced search
+++have to do normal search first to get the Advanced option!!!
---organism - human
---disease/phenotyp - aniridia

---pretty much the genecards list!!!

---hit pax6
---note elp4 very close and was in hit lest just left
----interesting? Not erally as ELP4 also called PAX6NEB ...
----implying only association is locational!
++++ wrong, it causes acgenital aniridia .. even more weird?

---conclusion? text searcing is not good at common sense! Just search for text.
+++ sadly cannot make this point ... yet

---From the summary (selective for bits of interest here):
---   Domains - homeobox & paired box
---   Isoforms - more than 1
---   Function - DNA binding
---   It regulates transcription, i.e. it is a transcription factor.

---Genomic Content
---   Chr 11 p13
---   Tells us there are 17 exons ... which is really not very interesting? Can you work out how many transcripts!!! Afraid best I could do was to count them as they appeared on the pretty picture.
---   click genome data viewer for pretty picture (Map Viewer)
---   back

---How many isoforms?
---RefSeq makes this difficult by associating proteins with transcripts, even when they are the same?
---By skimming down the details for each protein
---Seems to suggest 4? Isoform a,b,c,d. Uniprot begs to differ.
---From the picture, isoforms c & d are rather strange short ones supported by only one transcript each.

---Because it is convenient for the exercise, let us beleive UniProt (after a look)

---Therefore, a small intrusion into the Uniprot section of your course!

---Go to the bottome of the page and click on the UniProt/Swiss-Prot link
---If still necessary ... do whatever it takes to get to the newest version???

---Go to Sequences
---Uni suggest 3 isoforms but only 2 have sequence
---The difference between the 2 with sequence is 14 amino acids
---splicing in/out of a 42 base pair exon in the paired box domain
---do the alignment

---Go to Family & Domains
---click on the Graphical view for Interpro
---See a pictorial confirmation that PAX6 hase 2 domains 
---paired box followed by homeobox

---back back etc

---Look at the picture showing the 11 pax6 transcripts
---Ignore the inconvenient short ones
---Can you see which of the remainder are what uni calls isoform 5a and refseq calls isoform b (Hey!!! ---Talk to each other boys!! life is messy enough already)
+++Already covered

---Look for Related sequences
---    click on AB209177.1
---    search page for PAX6
---    does not occur in entry at all!
---    Title says "paired box gene 6"
---    "Gene Name" field is missing??????
---    WIll not be found with a search for "PAX6" surely it should be? That is its official gene name!
---   Hence we need GO ... see later

---search for domains
---3 ... paired. homeo, winged HTH within paired
---pity no picture?
+++Pictures at Uniprot, in fact, think I did most of this in uniprot

---copy simple searches from BOM ... lose the primer stuff

---OK ... Ensembl 
---  Interpro ... live explanation of picture
+++  Not made the picture yet but snuck in a bit about PRINTS
---  Need to mention pax - homeo but only sometimes
+++  yep ... transfer to BOM, that doc is Interpro and can be accessed easily from SMART
+++  I use SMART because I like blue things
---  homeo common pax ... just NINE
---  SNPs???
---  paralogues .... NINE /orthologues
---  3D structure good?
---  Need to biomart all human hox sequences for MSA
+++ NOOOOOOOOOO!!!! Not possible AND you have been all through this before boy!!!
+++ Did I ever have a memory! For next time .... everything is by gene!!
+++ ask for homeobox and you get entire homeobox gene proteins!!!
+++ have to use extractfeat :-( ... and somehow get around the pompus EBI removal of all the options
+++ who are those guys?? Or more pertenently, who do they imagine themselve to be!!
+++ Down boy! ... just do it ..
+++ Then have to think about the use of clustalx ... which I still rate,
+++  but is not available except at NL (they only maintain it because I asked them,
+++  how long will Dick/Harm keep that up?)
+++ also japan? ... do not know anyone out there, well except for the KEGG chap? Nope, too risky.

+++ Pity, seems we lose biomart ... unless I can think of another excuse?

End doing a straight Interpro?

MUST finish here ... surely over time already!

2017.05.08 - 2017.05.08-12 .................. BUGS!!
==========================================================

Search reveals 61 not 51 hits
isoforma/b confusion ..... fixed
Gene to Nucleotide conversion still not fixed??????? .... was fixed!
                             they did not follow exactly the notes!!
Search Chomosome 11 AND pax6 no longer finds single hit!!
                changed pax6 to "paired box 6" ... this works
