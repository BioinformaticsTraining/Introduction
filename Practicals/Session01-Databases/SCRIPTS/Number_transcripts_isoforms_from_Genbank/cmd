#Download the Genetic sequence from NCBI
#
#Examine and see that all transcipts are noted, once each, in a line including
#the words "product" & "isoform"
#
#Further note, those line each record the isoform for each transcript,
#and any given isoform can be associiated with multiple transcripts
#
############
#
#So ----
#
# 1 - filter the Genbank sequence for all lines including the two magic words
# 2 - sort the filtered line by alphabet {not reaaly necessary, but ... why not?}
#     the number of lines filtered should equal the number of transcripts
# 3 - sort the filtered lines again, this time eliminating duplication
#     the number of surviving lines should now represent the number of isoforms
# 4 - count the lines in each filtered list and display the counts
# 5 - for each isoform indentifer in turn (the letters a,b,c,...are used)
#     - pick out and count the lines for just that isoform
#     - display the number ofmatching lines
# 6 - sit back an adopt the air of one who has completed a noble task
