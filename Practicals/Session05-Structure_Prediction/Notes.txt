Had to reintroduce a look at the UniProtKB 2D structure into the Databases exercise.
Also cleared up a few bugs there ... including residual mentions of GeneCards.

Need to check notes on Jalview colouring schemes ... I am no longer convinced!

Changed to JSmole ... which was painful but seemed to work. Jmol does not appear to work anymore? Me? Or Life moving on?

Insufficient motivation to revisit the colouring scheme issues. Next time? Or maybe just accept what we do as sufficient?
